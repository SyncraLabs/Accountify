# Branding Guidelines

## 1. Visual Identity

**Appcountability** uses a high-contrast, "Dark Mode" aesthetic accented by vibrant neon colors to evoke energy, focus, and a futuristic/tech feel.

### Color Palette

| Color Name | Hex Code | Utility Class | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neon Lime** | `#BFF549` | `bg-primary`, `text-primary` | Primary actions, highlights, success states |
| **Void Black** | `#000000` | `bg-background` | Main background |
| **Dark Gray** | `#1A1A1A` | `bg-card` | Cards, modals, sidebars |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | `text-foreground` | Primary text |
| **Muted Gray** | `#A1A1AA` | `text-muted-foreground` | Secondary text, labels |

### Typography
We use **Outfit** (Google Font) for its geometric, modern, and clean appearance.

-   **Headings**: Bold / ExtraBold. Tight tracking.
-   **Body**: Regular / Medium. Readable and clean.

### Iconography
-   **Library**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
-   **Style**: Thin strokes (1.5px or 2px), consistent with the clean UI.

## 2. Tone of Voice
The app speaks like a **Coach** or a **Comrade in Arms**.

-   **Motivational**: "Keep pushing," "You're on fire today."
-   **Direct**: "Complete your tasks," "Don't break the chain."
-   **Gamified**: Uses terms like "Streak," "Level," "Squad," "Warrior."

## 3. Logo
The logo is a stylized symbol representing growth and connection.
-   **Path**: `/public/logo.svg`
-   **Usage**: Should always appear in Neon Lime on dark backgrounds.
